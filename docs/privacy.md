### Privacy Policy
Effective Date: October 30, 2025  
Last Updated: October 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Iman Khan (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Calmr mobile application and related services (the “Service”). Calmr provides tools and education to help you reduce emotional overeating.

## 1) Information We Collect
- Account information: email address; name if you provide it; authentication method (Apple, Google, or email/password).
- Profile information you choose to add: age, goals, preferences.
- Progress entries you create: check‑ins, hunger/satiety inputs (e.g., “Real Hunger”, “Satiety Compass”), pledges, reflections, and optional weight/goal data.
- Device and usage data: app version, device model/OS, in‑app interactions, basic diagnostics and crash data.
- Support communications: messages or emails you send to us.
- Local storage/cookies: used for session management and preferences. We do not use third‑party advertising cookies.

We do not collect precise location, contacts, or Apple Health data. We do not sell your personal information.

## 2) How We Use Information
- Provide and operate the Service (including personalized guidance and progress tracking).
- Authenticate users, maintain security, and prevent fraud/abuse.
- Analyze usage to improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
- Communicate service updates and respond to support requests.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.

## 3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK where applicable)
We rely on performance of a contract (to provide the Service), legitimate interests (e.g., app improvement, security) without overriding your rights, consent where required, and compliance with legal obligations.

## 4) Sharing of Information
- Service providers (processors): hosting, authentication, infrastructure, analytics, and support (for example, Supabase). They process data under our instructions with appropriate safeguards.
- Authentication and platform providers: Apple and Google for sign‑in.
- Payments and subscriptions: Apple’s App Store processes in‑app purchases, renewals, and refunds; we receive limited transactional information.
- Legal and safety: to comply with law, protect rights and safety, or in a corporate transaction.

We do not sell your data and do not share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising.

## 5) Data Retention
We keep data while your account is active and as needed for the purposes above. When you request deletion, we delete or anonymize data unless retention is required by law or for legitimate business needs (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution).

## 6) Your Rights
Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict/object to processing, and to withdraw consent. To exercise your rights, contact us at imanzkhan26@gmail.com. You may also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.

## 7) Your Choices and Account Deletion
- You can update some information in the app.
- To delete your account and associated personal data, email imanzkhan26@gmail.com from your account email with the subject “Calmr Account Deletion.” We will verify and complete deletion within a reasonable period (typically 30 days), subject to lawful retention requirements.

## 8) Children’s Privacy
The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child provided data, contact us and we will delete it.

## 9) International Transfers
We may process and store data in countries outside your own (for example, the United States). Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect cross‑border data transfers.

## 10) Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 11) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy. We will post the new version here and update the “Last Updated” date. Material changes may also be communicated in‑app.
