Last Updated: October 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Iman Khan (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Calmr mobile application and related services (“the Service”). Calmr provides tools and education to help you reduce emotional overeating.

## 1) Information We Collect
### a) Information you provide
- **Account information:** email address; name if you provide it; authentication method (Apple, Google, or email/password).  
- **Profile information:** age, goals, and preferences you choose to add.  
- **Progress entries:** check-ins, hunger/satiety inputs (e.g., “Real Hunger” or “Satiety Compass”), pledges, reflections, and optional weight/goal data.  
- **Support messages:** emails or messages you send to us.

### b) Automatically collected data
- **Device + usage data:** device type, OS version, app version, basic diagnostics, and in-app interactions.  
- **Crash reports:** via platform providers (e.g., Apple).  
- **Local storage/cookies:** used only for session management and preferences.

### c) Meta SDK (Facebook SDK)
If you allow tracking through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt, the Meta SDK may receive:
- **App interactions** (e.g., feature usage)
- **Device identifiers** (IDFA *only if you grant permission*)
- **Coarse device information** (device type, OS)
- **Attribution/installation data**

If you **decline** tracking, Meta SDK receives **only non-tracking, privacy-preserving data** needed for essential functionality (e.g., install attribution, aggregated analytics).

We do **not** collect:
- precise location  
- contacts  
- Apple Health data  
- sensitive categories of personal data  

We do **not** sell personal data.

We use the information described above to:
- Provide, personalize, and operate the Service  
- Authenticate users and maintain the security of accounts  
- Understand app performance and improve reliability  
- Communicate with you about updates and support  
- Process purchases through Apple (we do not store full payment details)  
- Optimize onboarding, retention, and app experience through privacy-compliant analytics  
- **Optimize ads and measure app install performance using the Meta SDK (only if permitted; see ATT section)**  
- Comply with legal requirements and enforce our Terms

## 3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK if applicable)
We rely on performance of a contract (to provide the Service), legitimate interests (e.g., app improvement and security), consent where required (e.g., tracking permissions), and compliance with legal obligations.

## 4) Sharing of Information
We may share information with:
- **Service providers:** hosting (e.g., Supabase), backend infrastructure, analytics, email/support tools  
- **Authentication and platform providers:** Apple and Google sign-in
