Effective Date: October 30, 2025  
Last Updated: October 30, 2025

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Calmr app and related services (the “Service”) provided by Iman Khan (“we”, “us”, “our”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1) What Calmr Is (and Isn’t)
Calmr offers educational tools and habit‑building guidance to help reduce emotional overeating. Calmr does not provide medical or mental‑health advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek professional help for medical or psychological concerns or emergencies.

## 2) Eligibility and Account
You must be of legal age to form a contract in your jurisdiction and not barred from using the Service. Keep your credentials secure and notify us of any unauthorized use. You are responsible for activity under your account.

## 3) Subscriptions, Billing, Trials, and Cancellation
- Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple via in‑app purchase. Apple manages billing, renewals, trials, and refunds under Apple’s policies.
- Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- How to cancel: on iPhone/iPad, open Settings → tap your name → Subscriptions → select Calmr → Cancel Subscription. You can also manage subscriptions from your Apple ID settings on Mac or the web.
- Prices, plans, and promotional offers are shown in‑app and may change. Taxes may apply. If prices change, new prices apply at the next billing period as permitted by Apple’s policies.
- We do not process your card details; Apple does. For refunds, use Apple’s refund process.

## 4) Acceptable Use
You agree not to violate laws; infringe others’ rights; reverse engineer, interfere with, or overload the Service; introduce malware; or use the Service to harass, harm, or mislead others.

## 5) User Content
If you submit content (e.g., check‑ins, reflections), you retain your rights. You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide license to host, process, and display it as needed to operate, secure, and improve the Service. Do not submit unlawful or infringing content.

## 6) Intellectual Property
The Service (software, content, graphics, trademarks) is owned by us or our licensors and protected by law. We grant you a limited, revocable, non‑transferable license to use the Service for personal, non‑commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms.

## 7) Third‑Party Services
Authentication (Apple, Google) and billing (Apple) are provided by third parties and subject to their terms. We are not responsible for third‑party sites or services.

## 8) Safety; Not Medical Advice
The Service is for informational and habit‑support purposes only. If you experience distress or medical issues, stop using the Service and seek professional help or contact local emergency services.

## 9) Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms, legal requirements, or to protect users or the Service. Sections intended to survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations) survive termination.

## 10) Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 11) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM (OR USD $50 IF NONE).

## 12) Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses, and expenses arising out of your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 13) Changes to the Service and Terms
We may modify or discontinue features at any time. We may update these Terms by posting a revised version with a new “Last Updated” date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 14) Governing Law; Venue
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. The courts located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada will have exclusive jurisdiction, unless mandatory consumer protection laws in your region provide otherwise.

## 15) App Store Terms (Apple)
If you downloaded the app from Apple’s App Store, you also agree to Apple’s Media Services Terms and Conditions. Apple is not responsible for providing maintenance or support for the Service and will not be liable for claims related to the app. Apple and its subsidiaries are third‑party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.
